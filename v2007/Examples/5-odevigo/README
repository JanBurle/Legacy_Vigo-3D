This example demonstrates a Vigo simulation that uses Open Dynamics Engine
(http://www.ode.org/) to simulate physics.
Hovering the mouse over an agent displays the agent's coordinates on the status
line.

To compile and run this example:

1) Download, build and install ODE.

2) To resolve conflicts between Vigo and ODE, edit the file ode/config.h
   (/usr/local/include/ode/config.h):
   - line 334: change "typedef char int8;" to "typedef signed char int8;"
   - line 340: change "typedef short int16;" to "typedef signed short int16;"
   - replace lines 347-348:
       typedef short int32;
       typedef unsigned short uint32;
     with:
       #ifdef VIGO_ODE_LINK
       typedef signed   int   int32;
       typedef unsigned int   uint32;
       #else
       typedef signed   short int32;
       typedef unsigned short uint32;
       #endif
     Note: I do not know why ODE typedefs short (16bit) as (u)int32, but that's
     how it is. By wrapping our typedefs in #ifdef VIGO_ODE_LINK/#else/#endif,
     I make sure that we do not break ODE. Please let us know if you know
     a better answer.

3) Finally, in the Examples/5-odevigo directory, run "make depend" and "make".

Many thanks to Marcin Pilat <http://pilat.org> for supplying this example.
