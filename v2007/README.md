# Vigo-3D

Vigo::3D was a library for multi-agent simulation and visualization in 3D space.
It is old and here for a reference.

**Vigo** for short (pronounced: /veeh-goh/) was a framework for simulating and
visualizing of three-dimensional scenes; suited for creating dynamical systems
of interacting agents, in which the agents move
in a three-dimensional space, and perceive ("see") their neighbours around them.

Vigo is written in C++ and the code was largely portable and ran on:

- MacOSX
- various Linuxes
- Windows with MinGW,
- and even probably on Solaris.
